As I have trained for AWS CCP and giving the AWS CLF-C01 (Certified Cloud Practitioner) exam soon, I wanted to build a project using the AWS services I learned. And what better than the reputed Cloud Resume Challenge created by Forrest Brazeal.

Visit https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/ for more information on this challenge.

### Step 1 (Resume must have CCP cert)
Fingers crossed, I would have certainly passed the exam by the time you, the reader, is reading this repo.

### Step 2,3,7 ( written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

I made my portfolio website an year ago using some HTML, CSS and JavaScript and deployed it on vercel. It's a very simple website.
I have to add the visitor counter as said in Step 7
Visit https://ritwik.vercel.app

### Step 4 (deploy it using S3)
Need to remove it from vercel and then deploy it using Amazon S3. Or keep the same website and do the other steps
